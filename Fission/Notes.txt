Fission is an alternate approach to the FORC client that moves more work onto
the client and less into the HTML5 side of the boundary.

Approach 1)

Forgo HTML5 entirely and use C#/WPF for the UI. Makes it harder to share
assets with the server side but makes binding between UI and code easier.

Approach 2)

Continue to use HTML5 for the UI and interaction. Pages could still be served
if required (rather than installed locally) allowing easier updates. Potential
issues with formatting depending on the installed browser on the client PC.
Unlike Fusion we do not control the application from the HTML5 side and rely
on the client to manage overall behaviour. This simplifies interaction, only
the client needs to know what is going on. Still requires some learning of the
interchange but allows greater sharing between server/client and has the
potential of making it easier to move logic to HTML5 when we have a better
understanding of what can actually be achieved.


Go for approach 1 in the immediate future in order to lock down required
behaviour and interaction with the server for authorisation, download and
installation purposes.

Mainpage shows current state + install/upgrade/play button.

If not authorised pop up the login dialog to establish the connection/session
information at which point the main page is available.

When the overall flow is known we can investigate replacing the controls and
windows with HTML pages and connecting them that way. Need to bear this in mind
when setting up the structure to make it as simple as possible to transition
if/when the time comes.
