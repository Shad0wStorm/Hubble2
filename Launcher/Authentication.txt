Notes on the Authentication Process

Introduction

This is being added to review the existing authentication process as a precursor
to implementing the new Steam authentication paths.

Existing process:

Main Window initialisation (CobraBayWindow::OnInitialised)
	Calls View.ResetManager()
		Sets up default server connection and language.
		Sets up FrontierMachineIdentifier.
		Calls Manager.AutoLogin()
			If Email or Password in user details are null return immediately.
			Calls Authenticate
				Calls ServerConnection.GetAuthorisation
					Forwards to FORCAuthorisationManager.GetAuthorisation
						If an existing token exists
							Request a session token
								On rejection clear security blob and existing token
									Ensures subsequent manual login starts from clean.
								If AutoLogin abandon attempt.
			If not authenticated call ResetLogin(true,true).
				Retains existing user parameters.
				Calls ServerConnection.ResetLogin.
					Forwards to FORCAuthorisationManager.ResetLogin.
						Clears security blob.
		Calls UpdateProjectList and AutoRun. Behaviour will be affected by the
			current authorisation state but will not attempt to change it.
	Calls Update()
		May call View.UpdateAuthorisation()
			Logs Authorisation state.
		Sets Register button visible if not authorised.
		Call SetCommanderName()
		Calls PerformStartUpChecks()

Main Window Shown (ContentRendered event calls CobraBayWindow::OnShown)
	Calls IsRegistrationRequired()
		If Steam:
			If no email address show modal register window.
				Register -> Start external browser for registration.
				Login -> Close window and open standard login window.

Standard Login Window
	Status and help information skipped for clarity.
	while not authorised:
		If twofactorrequired:
			Request validation code from email
		else:
			Request Username and Password values (defaulting to stored values if available)
		If close:
			Abort login, return to main window.
		If submit:
			Authenticate(non-automatic)
			If authorised:
				completed, return to main window

Extensions:
	Extend UserDetails to contain a SteamID & Registration link.
	Fill out if Steam can be initialised.
	Needs to store whether Steam is active (sessionticket?) due to different product list end point.
	
	AutoLogin will check user name/password if present, SteamID if not.
		If SteamID not recognised store registration link.
		If SteamID recognised and has products mark as authenticated with FORC token.
		Other responses at this stage take the usual unauthenticated paths.
	
	IsRegistrationRequired()
		If Steam and SteamID:
			** Can we check in advance if the Steam user can register (Get on /user/steam/link?) **
			If not do not display registration window, fall back to existing login.
			New Registration Window:
				Login as existing user.
				Register as new user->Second page with browser to handle registration?
				
	If authenticated via Frontier account offer link on initial login only and
	via menus?
