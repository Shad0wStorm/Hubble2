Extend VersionInfo.txt to include a value indicating a Project can be used
offline. Also a page reference for a UI front end.

Offline Projects will always be in the list of Available Products.

Project Runner will check for offline projects and run them without the
magic options used for security. This means that if the user modifies the
versioninfo.txt file to say a project is offline when it is not it would appear
but running it would fail to provide the necessary information and it would
fail on start up. It also tidies up some issues with the original
mplementation where language options etc. would not be passed to the started
game.

CobraBay needs to manage an active project and select it from the available
projects.

How do we handle logging on when an offline project is selected since the play
button will be displayed rather than the log in button.

How do we select which of the available projects are selected.
