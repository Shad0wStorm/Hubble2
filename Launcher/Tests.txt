This solution folder contains projects used to test features but which are not
part of the release of any FORC Client project.

They are not unit tests and do not need to be run as part of the standard build
process and do not need to be actively maintained. It would be nice if they at
least build so people using "Build Solution" do not get errors.

If you need to test a specific feature it is worth checking if an existing test
covers it and can be extended for the identified issue.
